title: About Me

I'm an avid data and sports enthusiast. I actually taught myself Python by building my very own maching learning project. The result of the project was a fully functioning prediction system to predict daily fantasy points for NHL hockey players. The prediction system I built includes various ML models and a fully customizable linear optimizer. The result of my efforts culminated into a very successful 2018/2019 fantasy hockey campaign which I hope to build off of in the coming year!
